# Task 0007: Implement AI inference engine with prompt templates

## Phase
Phase 2: Core Processing (Weeks 3-4)

## Description
Create the AI inference engine that processes activities using LLM with structured prompt templates and response parsing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design and implement primary prompt template for activity analysis
- [ ] Create structured JSON response parsing
- [ ] Implement confidence assessment logic
- [ ] Add entity extraction capabilities (people, projects, technologies)
- [ ] Create context update determination logic
- [ ] Implement prompt template versioning
- [ ] Add response validation and error handling
- [ ] Create reasoning and explanation tracking

## Dependencies
- Task 0004 (Ollama integration)
- Task 0005 (Data models)

## Estimated Effort
5-6 days

## Technical Notes
- Use structured prompts with clear instructions and examples
- Implement JSON schema validation for AI responses
- Add timeout handling for long-running AI requests
- Consider token counting and optimization
- Implement prompt template versioning for A/B testing
- Add comprehensive logging of AI interactions
- Handle malformed AI responses gracefully

## Definition of Done
- AI can process activities and extract entities
- Confidence assessment is working
- JSON response parsing is robust
- Prompt templates are versioned and maintainable
- Error handling covers all edge cases
- AI interactions are properly logged and trackable
