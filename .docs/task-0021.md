# Task 0021: Performance optimization and load testing

## Phase
Phase 5: Production Readiness (Weeks 9-10)

## Description
Optimize system performance and conduct comprehensive load testing to ensure production readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile application performance and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize AI inference performance
- [ ] Conduct load testing with realistic scenarios
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Optimize memory usage and garbage collection
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks and SLAs

## Dependencies
- Task 0019 (Monitoring systems)
- All previous tasks (complete system)

## Estimated Effort
5-6 days

## Technical Notes
- Use Go profiling tools (pprof) for performance analysis
- Implement Redis or in-memory caching for profiles and context
- Optimize SQL queries with proper indexing
- Use connection pooling for database and AI service
- Conduct load testing with tools like k6 or artillery
- Implement performance regression testing
- Add memory and CPU optimization

## Definition of Done
- System handles expected load without degradation
- Performance bottlenecks are identified and resolved
- Caching reduces database load significantly
- Load testing validates scalability requirements
- Performance monitoring provides actionable insights
- SLA targets are met under normal and peak load
