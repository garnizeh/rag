# Task 0004: Set up Ollama integration and model management

## Phase
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

## Description
Implement integration with local Ollama instance for AI inference, including model management and health monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Ollama client wrapper with proper error handling
- [ ] Implement model management (download, list, health check)
- [ ] Add configuration for different models (deepseek-r1:32b, llama3, etc.)
- [ ] Implement request/response validation
- [ ] Add timeout and retry logic for AI requests
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for service unavailability
- [ ] Add Ollama health monitoring
- [ ] Implement basic prompt templating system

## Dependencies
- Task 0001 (Go project structure)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Technical Notes
- Use HTTP client to communicate with Ollama API
- Implement proper timeout handling (configurable timeouts)
- Add structured logging for AI interactions
- Consider caching mechanisms for model information
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for reliability
- Use context for request cancellation

## Definition of Done
- Ollama client can communicate with local instance
- Model management functions work correctly
- Health checking is implemented
- Error handling and retries are functional
- Basic prompt templating is available
- Configuration supports multiple models
