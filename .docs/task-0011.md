# Task 0011: Implement question generation and answer processing

## Phase
Phase 3: Intelligence Features (Weeks 5-6)

## Description
Build the interactive clarification system that generates questions for engineers and processes their responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement question generation based on AI confidence levels
- [ ] Create question types and prioritization logic
- [ ] Build question storage and retrieval system
- [ ] Implement answer processing and validation
- [ ] Add question-answer workflow management
- [ ] Create question expiration and cleanup
- [ ] Implement batch question processing
- [ ] Add question analytics and effectiveness tracking

## Dependencies
- Task 0007 (AI inference engine)
- Task 0009 (Context update logic)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Generate questions only for low-confidence AI inferences
- Implement question types (entity_clarification, project_scope, team_change)
- Add question priority levels (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high)
- Use natural language generation for clear questions
- Implement question deduplication logic
- Add context preservation for questions
- Consider question template system

## Definition of Done
- Questions are generated for ambiguous AI results
- Engineers can view and answer questions via API
- Answer processing updates context appropriately
- Question workflow is complete and tested
- Question analytics provide useful insights
- System avoids duplicate or unnecessary questions
