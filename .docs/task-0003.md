# Task 0003: Create basic API server with authentication

## Phase
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

## Description
Implement the core HTTP API server with JWT-based authentication, basic routing, and middleware setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Set up HTTP server using standard library with gorilla/mux
- [x] Implement JWT-based authentication middleware
- [x] Create basic route structure for all planned endpoints
- [x] Add request/response logging middleware
- [x] Implement CORS handling
- [x] Add basic health check endpoint (`/v1/system/health`)
- [x] Set up graceful shutdown handling
- [x] Add configuration management for server settings

## Dependencies
- Task 0001 (Go project structure)
- Task 0002 (Database schema)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Use JWT tokens for engineer identification
- Implement proper middleware chain (auth, logging, CORS, recovery)
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Use structured logging (e.g., logrus or slog)
- Implement rate limiting preparation (can be enhanced in Phase 4)
- Consider using OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation

## Definition of Done
- HTTP server starts and accepts requests
- JWT authentication is working
- All planned routes are stubbed out
- Health check endpoint returns proper status
- Graceful shutdown works correctly
- Basic middleware chain is functional
