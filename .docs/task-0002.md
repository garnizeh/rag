# Task 0002: Implement database schema and migration system

## Phase
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

## Description
Create the SQLite database schema with all required tables and implement a migration system for schema evolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create SQL schema files with all tables (engineers, raw_activities, engineer_profiles, ai_questions, processing_jobs)
- [ ] Implement migration system using goose library
- [ ] Create initial migration files
- [ ] Set up database connection management
- [ ] Add database initialization and setup scripts
- [ ] Implement proper indexing for performance
- [ ] Add database backup and restore capabilities

## Dependencies
- Task 0001 (Go project structure)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Technical Notes
- Use SQLite with Unix millisecond timestamps (INTEGER)
- Implement foreign key constraints and cascading deletes
- Create proper indexes for query performance:
  - `idx_activities_engineer_created`
  - `idx_questions_engineer_answered`
  - `idx_jobs_status_created`
  - `idx_engineers_updated`
  - `idx_profiles_updated`
- Use goose for migration management
- Consider using sqlc for type-safe SQL query generation

## Definition of Done
- All database tables are created with proper schema
- Migration system is functional and tested
- Database can be initialized from scratch
- Performance indexes are in place
- Documentation for database setup is complete
