# Task 0022: Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E)

## Phase
Phase 5: Production Readiness (Weeks 9-10)

## Description
Create a comprehensive test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing for all system components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all core functions (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Build end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Add database testing with test fixtures
- [ ] Implement AI inference testing with mocked responses
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
- [ ] Add test automation and CI/CD integration
- [ ] Create test data management and cleanup

## Dependencies
- All previous tasks (complete system)

## Estimated Effort
6-7 days

## Technical Notes
- Use Go testing framework with testify for assertions
- Implement test doubles/mocks for external dependencies
- Use test containers for database testing
- Create realistic test data sets
- Implement parallel test execution where possible
- Add test coverage reporting and enforcement
- Use property-based testing for complex logic

## Definition of Done
- Test coverage exceeds 90% for core business logic
- All API endpoints have comprehensive integration tests
- End-to-end tests validate complete user workflows
- Tests run reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- Test suite completes in reasonable time
- Test failures provide clear debugging information
