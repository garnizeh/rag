# Task 0009: Develop context update logic and validation

## Phase
Phase 2: Core Processing (Weeks 3-4)

## Description
Implement the logic for updating engineer context based on AI inference results, including validation and conflict resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parse AI inference results and update engineer context
- [ ] Implement context validation and consistency checks
- [ ] Add logic for merging new entities with existing context
- [ ] Create context change detection and tracking
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Add context history and versioning
- [ ] Create context rollback capabilities
- [ ] Add context update notifications

## Dependencies
- Task 0007 (AI inference engine)
- Task 0005 (Data models)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Implement proper JSON handling for context fields
- Add validation for entity names and relationships
- Use atomic database transactions for context updates
- Implement conflict detection algorithms
- Add proper error handling for malformed context data
- Consider context diff tracking for audit purposes
- Implement proper locking for concurrent updates

## Definition of Done
- Context updates work reliably based on AI results
- Validation prevents invalid context states
- Conflict resolution handles edge cases
- Context history is maintained
- Update notifications are sent appropriately
- Rollback functionality is available when needed
