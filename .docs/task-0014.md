# Task 0014: Create context conflict resolution logic

## Phase
Phase 3: Intelligence Features (Weeks 5-6)

## Description
Implement intelligent conflict resolution when AI inferences contradict existing context or create inconsistencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detect context conflicts and inconsistencies
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Create conflict prioritization logic
- [ ] Add manual conflict resolution workflows
- [ ] Implement conflict logging and tracking
- [ ] Create conflict prevention mechanisms
- [ ] Add conflict resolution reporting
- [ ] Implement automated conflict resolution where safe

## Dependencies
- Task 0009 (Context update logic)
- Task 0011 (Question generation)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Implement conflict detection algorithms (duplicate entities, contradictory information)
- Use heuristics for conflict resolution (recency, source reliability, etc.)
- Generate clarifying questions for complex conflicts
- Add conflict severity assessment
- Implement conflict resolution history tracking
- Use transaction rollback for failed resolution attempts
- Add conflict notification system

## Definition of Done
- Context conflicts are automatically detected
- Resolution strategies handle common conflict types
- Manual resolution workflows are functional
- Conflict tracking provides audit trail
- Automated resolution works for simple cases
- Complex conflicts generate appropriate questions
