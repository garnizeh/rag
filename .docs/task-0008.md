# Task 0008: Create background job processing system

## Phase
Phase 2: Core Processing (Weeks 3-4)

## Description
Implement a robust background job processing system for handling AI inference and other asynchronous tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create job queue system with worker pool
- [ ] Implement job types (activity_processing, profile_generation)
- [ ] Add job status tracking and updates
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Create dead letter queue for failed jobs
- [ ] Add job priority and scheduling
- [ ] Implement graceful worker shutdown
- [ ] Add job monitoring and metrics

## Dependencies
- Task 0005 (Data models)
- Task 0007 (AI inference engine)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Use Go channels and goroutines for job processing
- Implement configurable worker count
- Add proper context handling for job cancellation
- Use database for job persistence and status tracking
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Add comprehensive logging for job lifecycle
- Consider using existing job queue library (e.g., asynq)

## Definition of Done
- Job queue can process tasks asynchronously
- Worker pool management is functional
- Retry logic handles transient failures
- Job status tracking works correctly
- Dead letter queue captures permanent failures
- System can gracefully shut down workers
