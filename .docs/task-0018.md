# Task 0018: Implement real-time status updates

## Phase
Phase 4: User Experience (Weeks 7-8)

## Description
Create real-time status update capabilities to provide users with immediate feedback on processing status and system state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement processing status tracking
- [ ] Create real-time status endpoints
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for live updates
- [ ] Implement status change notifications
- [ ] Create status dashboard data
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running tasks
- [ ] Implement status history and logging
- [ ] Create status-based UI feedback

## Dependencies
- Task 0008 (Background job processing)
- Task 0016 (API endpoints)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Implement proper connection management and cleanup
- Add status event broadcasting system
- Use efficient data structures for status tracking
- Implement status caching for performance
- Add proper error handling for connection failures
- Consider scalability for multiple concurrent connections

## Definition of Done
