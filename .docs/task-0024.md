# Task 0024: Deployment automation and monitoring

## Phase
Phase 5: Production Readiness (Weeks 9-10)

## Description
Implement deployment automation, infrastructure as code, and production monitoring setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Docker containers and docker-compose setup
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- [ ] Create infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- [ ] Set up production monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement automated backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Create environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Add deployment rollback capabilities
- [ ] Implement blue-green or rolling deployments

## Dependencies
- Task 0021 (Performance optimization)
- Task 0022 (Test suite)

## Estimated Effort
5-6 days

## Technical Notes
- Use multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- Implement proper secrets management
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Implement proper logging and monitoring in production
- Add health checks for container orchestration
- Use proper versioning and tagging strategies

## Definition of Done
- Automated deployment pipeline works reliably
- Infrastructure can be provisioned consistently
- Production monitoring provides comprehensive visibility
- Backup and recovery procedures are tested
- Deployment rollback works quickly and safely
- All environments are properly configured and isolated
