# Task 0019: Create monitoring and health check systems

## Phase
Phase 4: User Experience (Weeks 7-8)

## Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring, health checks, and observability features for system reliability and debugging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create detailed health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement system metrics collection
- [ ] Add application performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerting and notification system
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Add dependency health monitoring
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Implement automated health reporting

## Dependencies
- Task 0004 (Ollama integration)
- Task 0008 (Background processing)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Use structured logging with proper levels
- Implement metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- Add health checks for all dependencies (database, Ollama, etc.)
- Use proper monitoring patterns (RED/USE methods)
- Implement distributed tracing for request flows
- Add performance profiling capabilities
- Consider using existing monitoring tools (Grafana, etc.)

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive health checks cover all system components
- Metrics provide visibility into system performance
- Alerting notifies of system issues promptly
- Monitoring data supports effective debugging
- Dashboard provides clear system overview
- Performance bottlenecks are easily identifiable
