# Task 0015: Implement activity pattern analysis

## Phase
Phase 3: Intelligence Features (Weeks 5-6)

## Description
Build analytics capabilities to identify patterns in engineer activities and work behaviors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze activity frequency and timing patterns
- [ ] Identify collaboration patterns and relationships
- [ ] Detect project lifecycle patterns
- [ ] Implement skill usage and development tracking
- [ ] Create workload and productivity insights
- [ ] Add pattern-based predictions
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection in activity patterns
- [ ] Create pattern visualization data

## Dependencies
- Task 0006 (Activity ingestion)
- Task 0009 (Context update logic)

## Estimated Effort
5-6 days

## Technical Notes
- Use time series analysis for activity patterns
- Implement statistical analysis for collaboration networks
- Add machine learning for pattern recognition
- Use sliding windows for trend analysis
- Implement proper data aggregation and summarization
- Add configurable pattern detection parameters
- Consider privacy implications of pattern analysis

## Definition of Done
- Activity patterns are accurately identified
- Collaboration insights are generated
- Skill development trends are tracked
- Workload patterns are analyzed
- Anomaly detection works correctly
- Pattern data is available for visualization and reporting
