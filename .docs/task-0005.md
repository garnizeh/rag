# Task 0005: Implement core data models and repository patterns

## Phase
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

## Description
Create Go structs for all data models and implement repository patterns for database operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define Go structs for all database entities (Engineer, Activity, Profile, Question, Job)
- [ ] Implement repository interfaces for each entity
- [ ] Create repository implementations using sqlc or manual SQL
- [ ] Add CRUD operations for all entities
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Add transaction support for complex operations
- [ ] Create data transfer objects (DTOs) for API responses
- [ ] Add JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for all models

## Dependencies
- Task 0001 (Go project structure)
- Task 0002 (Database schema)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Technical Notes
- Use proper Go naming conventions
- Implement interfaces for testability
- Add proper validation tags (e.g., using validator package)
- Consider using sqlc for type-safe SQL query generation
- Implement proper error wrapping and handling
- Add database transaction management
- Use Unix millisecond timestamps consistently

## Definition of Done
- All data models are defined and documented
- Repository patterns are implemented for all entities
- CRUD operations work correctly
- Transaction support is available
- Validation is in place for all models
- JSON serialization works properly
