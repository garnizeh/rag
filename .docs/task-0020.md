# Task 0020: Add rate limiting and security hardening

## Phase
Phase 4: User Experience (Weeks 7-8)

## Description
Implement comprehensive security measures including rate limiting, input sanitization, and security best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement API rate limiting with configurable limits
- [ ] Add input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Implement proper CORS handling
- [ ] Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Create authentication and authorization enhancements
- [ ] Implement request size limits
- [ ] Add IP-based rate limiting and blocking
- [ ] Create security audit logging

## Dependencies
- Task 0003 (API server with authentication)
- Task 0017 (Validation and error handling)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Technical Notes
- Use token bucket or sliding window for rate limiting
- Implement per-user and per-IP rate limits
- Add proper input sanitization for all text inputs
- Use security middleware for headers and CORS
- Implement proper JWT token validation and refresh
- Add request logging for security audit
- Consider using security scanning tools

## Definition of Done
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Security headers are properly configured
- Input sanitization prevents injection attacks
- Authentication and authorization are secure
- Security audit logging captures relevant events
- System passes basic security assessment
